## Script Selection Guide

- **Version A (Recommended):** Data-driven restaurants (family businesses, established, professional tone)
- **Version B:** Softer approach (younger owners, casual vibe, friendly tone)
- **Version C:** Ultra-short (for testing on busy owners, low engagement accounts)

---

## Version A: Direct + Data-Driven

**Best for:** Established restaurants, family businesses, professional owners  
**Tone:** Confident, helpful, data-backed  
**Length:** 4 sentences

```
Hey [Restaurant Name] team!

Quick observation: You have 400+ Yelp photos but no digital menu page. That means anyone Googling "[restaurant name] menu" can't find you — they're bouncing to competitors with online menus.

I went ahead and built yours: [preview link]

54 items, 6 categories, ready to publish. If you like it, it's $99 (includes QR code + Yelp/Google submission). If not, no worries.

What do you think?
```

**Key elements:**
- Problem: "no digital menu page"
- Agitate: "bouncing to competitors"
- Solution: "I went ahead and built yours"
- Specificity: "54 items, 6 categories"
- Low pressure: "If not, no worries"

---

## Version B: Softer + Solution-First

**Best for:** Younger owners, casual restaurants, friendly brand tone  
**Tone:** Warm, helpful, collaborative  
**Length:** 3 sentences

```
Hi! I help family restaurants get discovered online.

Noticed [Restaurant Name] doesn't have a digital menu — I built one for you from your Yelp photos: [preview link]

If you like it, it's yours for $99 (QR code + file downloads + Yelp submission included). If not, at least you got to see what it could look like 😊

Let me know!
```

**Key elements:**
- Lead with value: "help family restaurants"
- Solution-first: "I built one for you"
- Emoji: Softens the ask
- "At least you got to see" = reciprocity trigger

---

## Version C: Ultra-Short (Mobile-Optimized)

**Best for:** Testing on busy owners, low engagement accounts, A/B testing  
**Tone:** Direct, no-nonsense, scannable  
**Length:** 2 sentences

```
Hey [Restaurant Name]!

Built your digital menu from Yelp photos: [preview link]

$99 if you want it (QR + Yelp submission included). Thoughts?
```

**Key elements:**
- Shortest possible (mobile-friendly)
- Solution-first (no problem statement)
- Direct pricing (filters time-wasters)
- Single question CTA

## Personalization Variables

**Required:**
- `[Restaurant Name]` → Use exact name from Instagram handle
- `[preview link]` → `menusready.com/preview/[slug]`

**Optional (for Version A):**
- `400+ Yelp photos` → Actual count from Yelp
- `54 items, 6 categories` → Actual menu stats

---

## Follow-Up Strategy

**If no response in 48 hours:**
1. Send Version C as a bump (shorter, re-engages)
2. Wait 5-7 days
3. Final bump: "Still interested? Happy to update the preview if anything's changed."

**If they respond "not interested":**
- Reply: "No problem! Menu stays live at [link] if you change your mind. Good luck!"
- Mark as "declined" in tracking sheet

**If they respond with questions:**
- Answer immediately
- Reference FAQ section on landing page
- Offer to hop on a quick call if needed

---

## Testing Plan

**Week 1:**
- Send Version A to 5 prospects
- Send Version B to 5 prospects
- Track: Open rate, response rate, conversion rate

**Week 2:**
- Double down on winning version
- Test Version C vs winner
- Refine based on responses

---

## Tracking Metrics

**For each DM sent, log:**
- Restaurant name
- Instagram handle
- Yelp photo count
- Menu item count
- DM version sent (A/B/C)
- Date sent
- Response? (yes/no)
- Response type (interested/questions/declined)
- Conversion? (yes/no)
- Time to conversion (hours)

**Target metrics:**
- 20% response rate (good)
- 10% conversion rate (great)
- 24-48hr response time (fast)

## Psychology Principles Used

1. **Reciprocity:** "I already built it for you"
2. **Loss aversion:** "competitors with online menus"
3. **Social proof:** "400+ Yelp photos" (implies popularity)
4. **Scarcity (subtle):** "ready to publish" (implies it could go away)
5. **Transparency:** Upfront pricing ($99)
6. **Low pressure:** "If not, no worries"
